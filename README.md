# CRM Application Using Palantir Foundry

## üìå Overview

This project showcases a CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application built using **Palantir Foundry**, developed as part of a work sample test for Axis Data. The solution translates real-world business needs into a functional, interactive, and scalable CRM system using Foundry's powerful data infrastructure and Ontology tools.

The application helps sales and operations teams manage and analyze relationships between people (contacts) and companies (clients or leads), leveraging data modeling, ETL, and interactive dashboards.

## üß± Data Modeling

Two Object Types were created:

- **Person**:
  - Fields: Name, Email, Phone Number, Job Title, Company.
- **Company**:
  - Fields: Name, Address, Revenue, Industry, Website.

A **Link Type** was established between Person and Company using the company name as a foreign key to normalize the model and maintain referential integrity.
